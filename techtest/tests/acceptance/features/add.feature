Feature: Addition

    As a user of a calculator when I use the add function between numbers the numbers should be added together

@add
Scenario: Add two numbers together
    Given I enter "5" into the calculator
    And I hit "add"
    And I enter "10" into the calculator
    And I hit "equals"
    Then I see a result of "15"

@add
Scenario: Add three numbers together
    Given I enter "5" into the calculator
    And I hit "add"
    And I enter "10" into the calculator
    And I hit "add"
    And I enter "2" into the calculator
    And I hit "equals"
    Then I see a result of "17"

@add
Scenario: Add two numbers and multiply another
    Given I enter "5" into the calculator
    And I hit "add"
    And I enter "10" into the calculator
    And I hit "multiply"
    And I enter "2" into the calculator
    And I hit "equals"
    Then I see a result of "30"
